# After each response, generate 10 of the most logical suggestions for all 3 of the following categories with each deserving it's own file:

1. Frontend suggestions (docs\frontend_suggestions.md) 
2. Backend suggestions (docs\backend_suggestions.md)
3. Bonus suggestions (docs\bonus_suggestions.md)

# Here are some example suggestion categories: 

- Feature suggestions, 
- UI\UX suggestions, 
- Libraries, 
- Frameworks, 
- Security, 
- Error Handling, 
- APIs, 
- External Sources, 
- Tools, 
- Alternatives, 
- Content. 

The more the better. Just be sure to explain what it is and how it would help or make the project better. 

# On each table, you'll need several columns like below... 

- Name, 
- Description, 
- Price, 
- Supported OS,
- Link, 
- Pros, 
- Cons, 
- Your Grade (0 - 100), 
- Your Grade Explained (Why it's not 100 and where it lost points and how many points),
- User Rating (if available), 
- Popularity (# of downloads), 
- 10 Best Alternatives (as links), 
- Why you suggested it, 


and as many other columns as you feel like adding... the more, the better. I need at least those columns for every type of table that you suggest.
