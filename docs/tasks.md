This document tracks all tasks for tldx and updates them as they are completed and should include comments if there were any issues or anything with that task and what steps were taken to complete it successfully.
## Project Overview
**Objective**: A fast and feature-rich domain availability checker and ideation tool.  
**Success Criteria**: 
- Provide accurate domain availability checks.  
- Offer a wide range of TLDs and presets.  
- Support flexible output formats.  
- Maintain high performance and low resource usage.  
**Timeline**: Ongoing development with iterative feature releases.  
**Scope Boundaries**: The project focuses on domain checking and ideation, not domain registration or management.  
## Tracking Goals
**Primary Objectives**:  
- Track completion rate: Maintain ‚â•90% on-time task delivery  
- Quality assurance: Keep rework rate ‚â§10% of completed tasks  
- Issue resolution: Average resolution time ‚â§2 business days  
- Documentation: 100% of tasks include resolution notes and lessons learned  
- Resource monitoring: Track effort allocation and identify bottlenecks  
**Update Frequency**: Daily status updates, weekly progress reviews, bi-weekly trend analysis  
**Success Metrics**:  
- Progress visibility: [completed]/[total] tasks with percentage tracking  
- Quality score: Tasks completed without rework vs. total tasks  
- Timeline adherence: Actual vs. planned completion dates  
- Knowledge capture: Issues documented with resolution steps
